      <h3>What kind of audience will be on my site?</h3>
      <p>
        In my web site plan one of the things I stated was that my I webpage
        would be directed to all kind of audiences, since people who are having
        their first pet, or for those who have a lot of experience and just got
        here out of curiosity. I will make the information pretty easy-to-read
        in my website, thinking in those people who have not experience with
        their pets or maybe do not the name of the things they have to use to
        give their pets a better life. What shampoo does my dog need to use,
        what kind of food I need to give to my birds? Why my cat does not like
        that toy I bought her? Just to name a few. In the statement of my
        website, I said that I will answer questions for all kind of people,
        from beginners to the most experienced ones.

      <h3>
        What questions will your visitors expect your site to answer for them?
      </h3>
      <p>
        All the questions I will answer in the website, will come from all kind
        of topics regarding your pets. Their health, that for me is one of the
        more important ones. What kind of food can I give to my dog? How can I
        keep my cat clean? Which vaccines do my dog need? Which sport activities
        can I practice with my hamster? But I will not just talk about health
        here, that will be a little too boring for my visitors. Something really
        important that I believe everyone should know, it is the emotional part,
        and the emotional connections that we make with our little friends. How
        can I know if my dog is enjoying his time with me? Why my cat stopped
        being happy as usual? What can I do to give a more active life to my
        dog? The hygiene is something that some people ignore, and this can have
        I huge impact on your pet’s life, having a good hygiene with your pets
        can prevent a lot of disease and unnecessary risks in the future.
        Something a lot of people wonder when they go about this matter of
        hygiene, is that they do not know how to give a good one to their pets.
        Some of us do not know how to give a good shower to our dog, or we
        wonder if we even have to shower them. Some question we answer in the
        page would be like: “Which kind of shampoo do I need to buy for my dog?
        How many times per week do I need to shower my dog, how often do I need
        to change the water of my fishes?”. Our goal here is that we provide all
        the important information, so our customer can have an amazing great
        experience visiting our web pages.
