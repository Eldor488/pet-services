      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>
        My name is Enmanuel De los Santos, I’ve been working with computers with
        for some time till now, and you’ll be impressed of how many problems we
        can solve with it. This is why we created PetServices. Never wondered
        why your dog got sick when you gave him chocolate? Or why your cat
        stopped being energetic as he used to be? A lot of animals suffer in
        silence or do not get the attention they deserve because we do not know
        how to identify when they need it. At PetServices we are compromised to
        assist you so you can give your pet the best treatment they deserve. Our
        mission is that you and you cute friends can have an insanely great
        experience together.
